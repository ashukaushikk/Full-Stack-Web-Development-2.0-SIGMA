<!-- Question-5 :- You are tasked with building a webpage that displays an images gallery using a grid layout. The challenge is to ensure the gallery is visually appealing and functional on both large and small screens. On large screens, the gallery should display multiple images per row, while on small screens, it should collapse into a single column for optimal viewing. Refer to the attached images for visual reference. Implement this using CSS Grid and media queries for responsiveness. -->
