        <p class="text-justify px-40 pt-4"> <span class="font-bold text-2xl font-mono">His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth</span> writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents' garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned it into the world's most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the partheon of America's great innovatos, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remeber how they applied imagination to technology and business. </p>
