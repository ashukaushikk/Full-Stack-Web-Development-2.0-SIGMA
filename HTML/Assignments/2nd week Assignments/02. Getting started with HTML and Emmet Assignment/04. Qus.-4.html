    <h1>Here is a complete explanation of 3 html tags:</h1>
    <ol style="line-height: 25px;">
        <li><b><"article"></b> In HTML, the <"article"> element represents a piece of content that can theoretically be distributed to other websites or platforms without being an integral part of them. An entire blog post, news article, or similar content can be displayed with the <"article"> element.</li>
        <li><b><"body"></b> <"body"> tags in HTML are responsible for defining the main content within a page. This can include text, paragraphs, headings, images, tables, links, and videos.</li>
        <li><b><"p"></b> Paragraph is defined by the <"p"> tag.Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</li>
    </ol>
