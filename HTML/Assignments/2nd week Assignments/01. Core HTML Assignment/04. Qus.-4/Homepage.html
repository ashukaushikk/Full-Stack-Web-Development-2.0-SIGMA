        A full-stack developer is a professional web developer who works with the "full stack" of web technologies that power websites. Web development is generally split into two parts: the front end and the back end. Front-end web development is concerned with the design and layout of a website, such as how it looks and how users interact with it. Back-end web development involves writing code for the underlying technologies that make a website work, such as querying databases and processing data. A full-stack developer is someone who can do both front-end and back-end web development.
