    <h1>HTML Tags :-</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><b>!DOCTYPE</b> : In HTML, the doctype is the required "<!DOCTYPE html>" preamble found at the top of all documents. Doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather that returns the doctypeâ€¦</li>
        
        <li><b>A</b> : The "a" HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.</li>
        
        <li><b>ARTICLE</b> : The "article" HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable. Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</li>
        
        <li><b>AUDIO</b> : The "audio" HTML element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the ""source" element: the browser will choose the most suitable one.

        <li><b>B</b> : Defines bold text</li>

        <li><b>DIV</b> : The "div" HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).</li>

        <li><b>H1 TO H6</b> : The "h1" to "h6" HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. "h1" is the highest section level and "h6" is the lowest.</li>

        <li><b>HEAD</b> : The "head" HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.</li>

        <li><b>HEADER</b> : The "header" HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</li>

        <li><b>HTML</b> : HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</li>

        <li><b>TITLE</b> : The "title" HTML element defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.</li>
