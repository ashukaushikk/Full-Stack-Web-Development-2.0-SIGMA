    <h1>List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML</h1> <hr>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Provide Alternative Text for Images</b>: Adding descriptive alternative text (alt text) to images in HTML helps improve accessibility for visually impaired individuals who rely on screen readers. Alt text should accurately describe the content or purpose of the image so that those who cannot see the image can still understand its meaning.</li>
        Example: <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/blind-woman-walking-city-streets-using-her-white-cane-to-navigate-urban-space-better-get-destination-safely-200874699.jpg" width="250px" height="250px" alt="A person using a white cane to navigate the street"></br></br>
        
        <li><b>Use Semantic HTML Markup</b>: A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. For example, using heading tags (h1, h2, etc.) to denote headings, using lists for lists of items, and using the <"nav"> tag for navigation menus.</li> </br>
        
        <li><b>Implement Keyboard Accessibility</b>: Many people with disabilities rely on keyboard navigation instead of a mouse or other pointing devices. Ensuring that all interactive elements on a webpage, such as links, buttons, and form fields, can be accessed and activated using the keyboard is essential for accessibility.  use proper HTML tags such as <"button"> for buttons instead of <"div"> or <"span">.</li>
    </ol>
