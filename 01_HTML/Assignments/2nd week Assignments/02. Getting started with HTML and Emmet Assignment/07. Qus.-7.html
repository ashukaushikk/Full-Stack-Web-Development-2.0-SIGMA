    <h1>About the nesting operators in emmet</h1>
    <p>Emmet is a tool that allows web developers to write HTML and CSS code quickly and efficiently using shorthand syntax. Nesting operators are a set of special characters that allow developers to create nested HTML structures using simple and concise syntax.</p>
    <p>There are three nesting operators in Emmet:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>">" (Child operator)</b> : This operator is used to create a child element inside a parent element. For example, if you want to create a div element with an h1 element inside it, you can use the following syntax: div > h1.</li>
        <li><b>"+" (Sibling operator)</b> : This operator is used to create a sibling element next to another element. For example, if you want to create a div element followed by a p element, you can use the following syntax: div + p.</li>
        <li><b>"^" (Climb-up operator)</b> : his operator is used to climb up one level in the HTML structure. For example, if you want to create an ul element with two li elements inside it, and then create a div element outside of the ul element, you can use the following syntax: ul > li * 2 ^ div.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Using nesting operators in Emmet can save developers a lot of time and typing when creating complex HTML structures.</p>
